## Bio

GNU/Linux user since I am 14, I today am an advanced user of this
operating system, and passioned with programming.

I am currently a student in first year of a « DUT Informatique », a
two-year Computing Sciences diploma, at the **IUT of Lannion** (Brittany), and intend to continue
with my studies into a three-year engineering school afterwards.

In my work as in personal life, I value **rigor**,
**originality**, **clarity**, and to a certain
extent **minimalism**. I’m applying this through the use of
some tools like the text editor *VI*, the *dwm* windows
manager, or the *BÉPO* French keyboard disposition.

Algorithmics is the aspect of Computer Sciences attracting me the most
today. Through [my realizations](https://github.com/ribacq),
I am looking for more knowledge, and more than everything, experience.
